# Rendering - Part 2

Following on from part 1, we now want to start adding more functionality and create a library.

The rendering functions are now split in to render.rs and the test program is main.rs

We have now added the following functions:

* buffer_to_u32
* clear_buffer
* draw_square - this will probably be depricated soon
* draw_pixel
* draw_line
* draw_triangle
* draw_rect
