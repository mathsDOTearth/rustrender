# rustrender

Here lies my pointless experiments in rendering using the minifb crate.

OpenGL and Vulkan and many game engines will do what I am playing with much better, this is just me playing.

Also as a warning, I code Rust with a C accent, I am more of a C programmer, but Rust is my hobby.

* Part 01 - Setting up a 2d RGB buffer to work with minifb
* Part 02 - Creating pixel, line, tiangle and rectangle draw functions
