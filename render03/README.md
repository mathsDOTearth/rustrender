# Rendering - Part 3

In this part we add vector.rs which has a Vector3 struct for holding a point in 3d space and then implementing:

* new - create new vector
* add - sum two vectors together
* sub - find the difference between two vectors
* scale - multiply a vector by  a scalar
* dot - find the dot product of two vectors
* corss - find the cross product of two vectors

main.c now demos a rotating 3d wireframe cube.
